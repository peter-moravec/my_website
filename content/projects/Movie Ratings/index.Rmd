# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```
The null hypothesis: Mean IMDB Ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same (p-value => 0.05)
\n The alternative hypothesis: Mean IMDB Ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are not the same (p-value < 0.05)


## Replicating plot of confidence intervals for the mean ratings of the two directors

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```


```{r, fig.width = 13, fig.height=7}
#loading data
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))


#calculating the CIs
Two_directors <- movies %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg")) %>% 
  summarise(average_rating = mean(rating), 
            SD_rating = sd(rating), 
            count = n(), 
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            SE =  SD_rating/sqrt(count),  
            margin_of_error = t_critical * SE, 
            ci_low = average_rating - margin_of_error,  
            ci_high = average_rating + margin_of_error) 

#displaying statistics

xmin_rect = Two_directors %>% 
  filter(director == "Steven Spielberg") %>%

#plotting

```

## T test and Hypothesis test

```{r}
T_test <- movies %>%
  select(director, rating) %>%
  filter(director == "Steven Spielberg" | director == "Tim Burton")

t.test(rating ~ director, data =T_test)
```
Bases on the p-value of 0.01 which is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and assume that the average IMDB Ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are not the same.

```{r}
#calculating the differences in means
differences<- T_test%>%
specify(rating ~ director)%>%
calculate(stat="diff in means",order=c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton")) 

#simulating the null distribution
null_dist<-T_test%>%
specify(rating ~ director)%>%
hypothesize(null="independence")%>%
generate(reps=1000,type="permute")%>%
calculate(stat="diff in means",order=c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton"))

#Visualising null distibtution and p-value
null_dist %>% 
visualise() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = differences, direction = "two-sided") 
null_dist %>% get_p_value(obs_stat = differences, direction = "two_sided")
```

After running the test several times the p-value for the simulation based test was usually between 0.01 and 0.024, which is very close the one for our traditional test. Therefore, the same interpretation holds true - average IMDB Ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are not the same.
